                                FEB is UC Berkeley's premier FSAE EV team; every year we build a custom, in-house electric race car from the ground up, starting from first-principle-justified electrical and mechanical design concepts. Currently, we are preparing SN4, our fourth ever car, for competition in June 2025. After this, we shall begin the iterative process again and start designing our next car, SN5.

                                I am a member of the simulations-algorithms subteam, responsible for vehicle dynamics modeling, accumulator analysis, and optimum laptime calculations. These simulations are crucial for understanding and deciding aerodynamic and vehicle dynamic design choices (e.g. wing and frontal area, tire size and type, etc). Previously, we have developed custom point mass models, but we have advanced to a bicycle model built using Guass-Legendre Collocation and nonlinear programming (NLP) optimization. As of recently, we are most focused on refining our model for better convergence through methods, such as regularization and warm start. You can read more about the basis of our model here.

                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Rehabilitation In Augmented Reality (REIA)</div>
                            <p>
                                REIA is an on-going research project at the intersection of human-compuer interaction (HCI) and neurology, aimed at providing a novel approach to stroke physicalrehabilitation through mixed reality (MR). The ultimate goal of this project is to build a system capable of providing patients who have suffered stroke the ability to participate in physical therapy in the comfort of their own home, through virtual/remote consultations with medical professionals. Traditional stroke physical rehabilitation is very costly, not always accessible, and time-confusing for both patients and physical therapists, so this project hopes to bring accessability and affordability to patients, and scability to medical professionals. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Through this system, patients are able to video call therapists from a VR headset (i.e. Meta Oculus Quest 3); therapists will join via a custom portal, with access to patient notes, history, progress, videos, etc. During a consultation, patients will engage in physical therapy training scenarios just as they would in real life, only in augmented reality (AR) in their own home. These virtual training scenarios, such as reaching and grasping for an apple, have been replicated from physical scenarios that are considered standard medical practice for stroke rehabilitation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The headsets being used have advanced position and rotation tracking capabilities for upper extremities, allowing for data collection and trajectory evaluation; we also have the ability record patient movements in virtual reality (VR). I helped develop the pipeline for uploading and storing the numerical data and recordings from the headset and Unity to Google Cloud as well as creating evaluation criteria for patient movements through multivariate dynamic time-warping. Another feature of REIA is the LLM-Scenic-generation of virtual training scenarios by processing clinician annotations and instructions from consultations with patients.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The component I spent the most time on is efficient representation of large point clouds in 3D space through voxelization. The headset will record tens of thousands of points while a patient completes training scenarios, concentrated in areas reachable by a stroke patient's hand. Clinicians seek to view patients' reachable area for tracking progress and better catering training scenarios; to do this, one has to calculate the intersection of these points with other virtual objects (i.e. tables, shelves, etc.), but more efficiently by generalizing points into voxels (3D version of pixels). Now, tens of thousands of points can be accurately represented by only a few hundred voxels. Read more about voxelization and 3D space representation here. 
                            </p>

                                This research project is under the facilitation of the UC Berkeley EECS Department and in collaboration with and under guidance of Stanford Medicine and UCSF Neurorecovery Clinic.

                    <p>Apart from school, work, class, and clubs, I enjoy spending my time exercising and in the great outdoors: lifting in the gym, mountain biking in the hills of the East Bay and Marin County, hiking in Yosemite National Park and Pinecrest Lake.</p>

                    <p>Fun fact: I was born in Oakland CA, just south of Berkeley and completed all of my pre-secondary education in a town called Albany, just north of Berkeley!</p>
